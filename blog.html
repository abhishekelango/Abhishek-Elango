        <h2>How did I buy my Laptop without asking money from Parents?</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                So do you want to get a Laptop? Even I wanted one since 5 years but my family couldn't afford one so I tried various was of making money but I failed almost all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried to make YouTube videos but my phone had very less storage so i could not make videos again and again, anyways these are all just excuses i believe. then i tried makinglogos on Fiverr I rarely made any. I also ended up getting scammed by a company
                which asked me to deposit rs1000 to get rs7000 in a week by writing articles(Handwritten).
            </p>
            <p>
                Then when i finished my Board exams I started searching for a Job to get a laptop, unfortunately there were no jobs for me and then i asked a friend of mine who is of my age who works in a company to get me a job he couldn't help me but he helped me in
                making money. He used to give me Data Entry projects they were simple projects and by doing that i made enough to get myself a Laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the thing here is not everyone has a friend like i had so what can you all do? You all can search or mail companies saying let us know if you need to get anything done by us that is cold email them and atleast cold email 100 companies a day so that
                atleast 2 companies would revert back to you and you can discuss all of your charges with them and you will be getting paid once you get their job done youcan always google if you get stuck somewhere, also dm me on Instagram if you get
                some projects like these I would like to know your story.
